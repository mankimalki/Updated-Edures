# Year 5 Science Syllabus (UK National Curriculum)
*Statutory Programme of Study for Upper KS2 (DfE 2014, Updated per Ofsted Research Review 2023)*

---

## 1. Working Scientifically
### Core Skills (National Curriculum)
- **Planning**: Design multi-variable investigations (e.g., "How do light angle and surface material affect shadow size?")
- **Measuring**: Use precision instruments (Newton meters, graduated cylinders) with appropriate decimal places
- **Analysing**: Identify causal relationships using "if...then...because" reasoning
- **Evaluating**: Suggest improvements with scientific justification

**Ofsted Focus**:  
"Pupils should demonstrate increasing independence in experimental design" - Science Research Review 2023

---

## 2. Biology
### Living Things & Their Habitats
- **Life Cycles**: 
  - Compare metamorphic/non-metamorphic cycles (frogs vs. humans)
  - Reproductive processes in flowering plants (pollination/fertilisation)
- **Adaptations**:
  - Evolutionary advantages (desert plants, Arctic animals)
  - Human impact on ecosystems (case studies)

**Required Investigation**:  
"Seed Dispersal Efficiency Test" - Measure distances achieved by different dispersal methods

### Animals Including Humans
- **Human Development**:
  - Prenatal to adolescence changes
  - Puberty education (statutory requirement)
- **Circulatory System**:
  - Heart structure/function (pulse rate experiments)
  - Components of blood (simulated blood models)

---

## 3. Chemistry
### Properties & Changes of Materials
- **Material Science**:
  - Solubility investigations (temperature/surface area)
  - Thermal/electrical conductivity testing
- **Reversible/Irreversible Changes**:
  - Chemical reactions (burning, rusting)
  - Separation techniques (filtering, evaporation)

**Common Misconception**:  
"Melting and dissolving are the same process"

---

## 4. Physics
### Earth & Space
- **Solar System**:
  - Heliocentric model (relative planet sizes/distances)
  - Day/night and seasons (tilted Earth demonstration)
- **Forces**:
  - Gravity experiments (mass vs. weight)
  - Air/water resistance (parachute design challenge)

### Light
- **Optics**:
  - Refraction investigations (prisms, lenses)
  - Eye anatomy and vision defects

---

## Assessment Framework
### Working Towards Expected
- Describe basic life cycles
- Group materials by single properties
- Record simple measurements

### Expected Standard
- Explain adaptation examples
- Conduct fair tests independently
- Present data in appropriate formats

### Greater Depth
- Predict outcomes of material changes
- Design controlled experiments
- Critique experimental methods

---

## Teaching Approaches
### Practical Requirements
1. **STEM Links**: DT - Design space probes
2. **Fieldwork**: Local ecosystem studies
3. **Modelling**: Create 3D solar system models

**Lesson Sequence**:
- Engage (Provocative question)
- Explore (Practical investigation)
- Explain (Scientific principles)
- Elaborate (Real-world application)
- Evaluate (Peer review)

## Required Resources
| Topic | Equipment | Risk Assessment |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| Chemistry | Thermometers, chemicals | CLEAPSS guidelines |
| Physics | Prisms, force meters | Eye protection |
| Biology | Stethoscopes, models | Hygiene protocols |
