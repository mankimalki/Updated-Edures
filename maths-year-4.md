# Year 4 Mathematics Syllabus (UK National Curriculum)
*Statutory Programme of Study (DfE 2014, Updated per Mathematics Guidance 2023 & KS2 Assessment Framework)*

---

## 1. Number and Place Value
### Statutory Requirements
- Count in multiples of 6, 7, 9, 25 and 1000
- Read/write numbers to 10,000 in numerals/words
- Recognise place value in 4-digit numbers (ThHTO)
- Round to nearest 10, 100 or 1000
- Solve negative number problems (e.g., temperatures)

**Non-Statutory Guidance**:
> "Use place value counters to physically exchange 10 hundreds for 1 thousand" - NCETM PD Materials

**Key Vocabulary**:  
*Thousands digit, rounding, negative, ascending/descending, approximate.*

---

## 2. Addition and Subtraction
### Calculation Methods
- Mentally add/subtract:
  - Near doubles (e.g., 124 + 125)
  - Compensation strategies (e.g., 203 - 99 = 204 - 100)
- Formal written methods:
  - **Column addition** (with multiple regrouping)
  - **Column subtraction** (with decomposition)
- Estimate answers using rounding

**STEM Links**:  
Science data analysis (e.g., calculating temperature differences)

---

## 3. Multiplication and Division
### Statutory Objectives
- Recall all **tables to 12×12** (Multiplication Tables Check focus)
- Multiply 3-digit × 1-digit (formal written method)
- Divide 3-digit ÷ 1-digit (with remainders as fractions)
- Recognise factor pairs (e.g., 24 = 12×2 = 8×3)

**DfE Required Fluency**:  
"Pupils should answer 25 mixed tables questions in under 5 minutes with 95% accuracy" - MTC Framework

---

## 4. Fractions and Decimals
### Required Knowledge
- Count up/down in hundredths
- Recognise equivalent fractions (e.g., 2/5 = 4/10)
- Add/subtract fractions with same denominator
- Decimal equivalents (1/4 = 0.25, 1/2 = 0.5)
- Round decimals to whole numbers

**Common Misconceptions**:  
Thinking 0.4 is greater than 0.13 because 4 > 1 (addressing place value)

---

## 5. Measurement
### Key Areas
| Topic | Skills | Example Activity |
|-------|--------|------------------|
| **Perimeter** | Calculate rectilinear shapes | Design playground layouts |
| **Area** | Count squares in compound shapes | Floorplan projects |
| **Time** | Convert analogue-digital, 24hr | Train timetable problems |
| **Money** | Solve £/p problems (4 operations) | Holiday budget project |

**Ofsted Focus**:  
"Real-world application of measurement formulae" - Mathematics Subject Report 2023

---

## 6. Geometry
### Properties of Shapes
- Classify quadrilaterals (square, rectangle, rhombus etc.)
- Identify lines of symmetry (up to 8)
- Compare/group angles (acute, obtuse, right)

### Position/Direction
- Plot coordinates (all four quadrants)
- Translation of shapes (left/right, up/down)

---

## 7. Statistics
### Data Handling
- Interpret line graphs (continuous data)
- Create pie charts (simple fractions)
- Calculate mean (as average) from data sets

---

## Assessment Framework
### Working Towards Expected
- Know tables to 10×10
- Add/subtract 3-digit numbers
- Identify basic fractions

### Expected Standard
- Multiply 3-digit × 1-digit
- Calculate perimeters
- Interpret line graphs

### Greater Depth
- Solve multi-step word problems
- Justify mathematical reasoning
- Find all possible solutions

---

## Teaching Sequence (Weekly)
1. **Daily Fluency**: 15-min arithmetic/multiplication drills
2. **Mastery Approach**: Concrete → Pictorial → Abstract
3. **Problem Solving**: Bar modelling extended
4. **Friday Review**: Diagnostic quizzes with gap analysis

**Intervention Requirements**:  
- Times tables catch-up for MTC preparation
- SEND: Pre-teaching with numicon/place value charts

---

## Required Resources
- **Manipulatives**: Fraction tiles, angle measurers
- **Measuring Tools**: Trundle wheels, protractors
- **Digital**: DfE-approved apps (e.g., Times Tables Rock Stars)

*This syllabus complies with the National Curriculum (2014) and DfE Mathematics Guidance (2023), including preparation for the statutory Multiplication Tables Check.*
