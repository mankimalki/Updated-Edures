# Year 5 Mathematics Syllabus (UK National Curriculum)
*Statutory Programme of Study (DfE 2014, Updated per Mathematics Guidance 2023 & KS2 Teacher Assessment Frameworks)*

---

## 1. Number and Place Value
### Statutory Requirements
- Read/write numbers to **1,000,000** in numerals/words
- Count in powers of 10 (10², 10³, 10⁴)
- Interpret negative numbers in context (temperature, floors below ground)
- Round to nearest **10,000** or **100,000**
- Solve Roman numeral problems (to M)

**Non-Statutory Guidance**:
> "Use place value grids to explore the multiplicative relationship between columns" - NCETM Professional Development Materials

**Key Vocabulary**:  
*Millions, powers of ten, integers, rounding bounds, numeral.*

---

## 2. Addition and Subtraction
### Calculation Methods
- Mentally calculate:
  - Complements to 100 (e.g., 76 + __ = 100)
  - Near multiples (e.g., 203 - 198)
- Formal written methods:
  - **Multi-digit column addition** (up to 5 digits)
  - **Compact subtraction** with multiple exchanges
- Solve multi-step word problems

**STEM Links**:  
Science data analysis (e.g., calculating planetary distances)

---

## 3. Multiplication and Division
### Statutory Objectives
- Multiply:
  - 4-digit × 1-digit (short multiplication)
  - 2-digit × 2-digit (grid/long multiplication)
- Divide:
  - 4-digit ÷ 1-digit (short division)
  - With remainders as fractions/decimals
- Identify **prime numbers** (<100) and **square/cube numbers**

**DfE Fluency Benchmark**:  
"95% accuracy in 12×12 tables recall under timed conditions"

---

## 4. Fractions, Decimals & Percentages
### Required Knowledge
- Convert between:
  - Improper fractions ↔ mixed numbers
  - Fractions ↔ decimals (tenths/hundredths)
  - Fractions ↔ percentages (50% = ½)
- Calculate:
  - Fraction of quantities (⅜ of 64kg)
  - Equivalent FDP (0.25 = 25% = ¼)
- Order FDP with different denominators

**Common Misconceptions**:  
"0.45 is greater than 0.6 because 45 > 6"

---

## 5. Measurement
### Key Areas
| Topic | Skills | Example Activity |
|-------|--------|------------------|
| **Area/Perimeter** | Compound rectilinear shapes | Design theme park layout |
| **Volume** | cm³/m³, counting cubes | Packaging design |
| **Time** | Timetables with 24hr clock | Plan European rail journey |
| **Angles** | Measure to nearest degree | Protractor treasure hunt |

**Ofsted Focus**:  
"Precision in selecting appropriate units and tools" - Mathematics Subject Report 2023

---

## 6. Geometry
### Properties of Shapes
- Classify triangles (equilateral/isosceles/scalene)
- Identify 3D shapes from 2D nets
- Calculate missing angles (straight line = 180°)

### Position/Direction
- Translation/reflection using coordinates
- Solve problems involving scaling (e.g., map ratios)

---

## 7. Statistics
### Data Handling
- Interpret **line graphs** (interpolation/extrapolation)
- Calculate **mean averages**
- Create **pie charts** using protractors (30° = 1/12)

---

## Assessment Framework
### Working Towards Expected
- Multiply 3-digit × 1-digit
- Identify simple equivalent fractions
- Measure angles to 10°

### Expected Standard
- Calculate area of compound shapes
- Convert between FDP
- Solve multi-step word problems

### Greater Depth
- Justify mathematical reasoning algebraically
- Solve problems requiring multiple operations
- Derive unknown angles in complex shapes

---

## Teaching Sequence (Weekly)
1. **Daily Fluency**: 15-min arithmetic/FDP drills
2. **Mastery Approach**: Variation theory problems
3. **Problem Solving**: Multi-step STEM scenarios
4. **Friday Review**: Diagnostic assessments

**Intervention Requirements**:  
- Pre-teaching for complex concepts
- SEND: Concrete-Representational-Abstract (CRA) approach

---

## Required Resources
- **Manipulatives**: Place value counters to millions
- **Measuring Tools**: Angle finders, trundle wheels
- **Digital**: DfE-approved apps (e.g., Maths-Whizz)

*This syllabus complies with the National Curriculum (2014) and DfE Mathematics Guidance (2023), including preparation for KS2 SATs arithmetic and reasoning papers.*
