# Year 1 Science Syllabus (UK National Curriculum)
*Aligned with Key Stage 1 Requirements*

---

## 1. Scientific Enquiry (Working Scientifically)
### Skills Development
- **Observing**: Using senses and simple equipment (magnifying glasses, rulers)
- **Questioning**: "What happens if...?", "Why does...?"
- **Predicting**: Simple "I think... because..." statements
- **Investigating**: Fair testing (e.g., same-sized containers for water experiments)
- **Recording**: Drawings, tables, photographs
- **Evaluating**: "What did we find out?"

### Practical Activities
1. Melting ice cubes in different locations
2. Testing which materials float or sink
3. Measuring plant growth over time

## 2. Biology
### Plants
- **Identification**: Common wild/garden plants (daisy, oak, grass)
- **Structure**: Roots/stem/leaves/flowers (basic functions)
- **Growth Requirements**: Water, light, temperature
- **Seasonal Changes**: Deciduous vs evergreen trees

### Animals Including Humans
- **Classification**: Mammals, birds, fish, amphibians, reptiles
- **Body Parts**: Head, torso, limbs, senses
- **Basic Needs**: Food, water, air, shelter
- **Hygiene**: Importance of washing hands

### Seasonal Changes
- **Weather Patterns**: Temperature, rainfall, wind
- **Day Length**: Recording sunrise/sunset times
- **Nature Observations**: Leaf fall, hibernation, flowering

**Key Vocabulary**:  
*Root, petal, mammal, scales, season, temperature, hibernate.*

## 3. Chemistry (Everyday Materials)
### Properties
- **Material Types**: Wood, plastic, glass, metal, fabric
- **Characteristics**: 
  - Texture: rough/smooth
  - Flexibility: bendy/rigid
  - Transparency: opaque/transparent
  - Water resistance

### Investigations
1. Sorting materials by properties
2. Testing umbrella materials
3. Building waterproof houses for toys

**Key Vocabulary**:  
*Shiny, waterproof, absorbent, rigid, transparent.*

---

## 4. Physics
### Light and Dark
- **Light Sources**: Natural (sun) vs artificial (lamps)
- **Shadows**: How they form and change
- **Safety**: Never look directly at the sun

### Forces and Movement
- **Push/Pull**: Making objects move/stop
- **Slopes**: How steepness affects movement
- **Floating/Sinking**: Basic buoyancy concepts

**Key Vocabulary**:  
*Shadow, push, pull, float, sink, fast, slow.*
