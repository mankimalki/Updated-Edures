# Year 4 Science Syllabus (UK National Curriculum)
*Statutory Programme of Study for Lower KS2 (DfE 2014, Updated per Ofsted Research Review 2023)*

---

## 1. Working Scientifically
### Core Skills (National Curriculum Statements)
- **Planning**: Design comparative tests with controlled variables (e.g., "What affects evaporation rate?")
- **Measuring**: Use digital tools (data loggers, thermometers) with appropriate precision
- **Recording**: Construct line graphs for continuous data (e.g., temperature changes)
- **Analysing**: Identify patterns and propose explanations using scientific knowledge

**Ofsted Focus**:
> "Pupils should move from 'what' to 'why' explanations using substantive knowledge" - Science Research Review 2023

## 2. Biology
### Living Things & Their Habitats
- **Classification**:
  - Use dichotomous keys for local species
  - Vertebrate/invertebrate characteristics
- **Environmental Change**:
  - Impact of deforestation/pollution
  - Food chain disruptions (introduced species)

**Required Investigation**:
"Microhabitat Biodiversity Survey" - Compare species abundance under logs vs open grass

### Animals Including Humans
- **Digestive System**:
  - Process from mouth to intestine (model making)
  - Tooth types and functions (incisors/canines/molars)
- **Food Chains**:
  - Construct complex chains with multiple consumers
  - Producer/consumer/prey relationships

---

## 3. Chemistry
### States of Matter
- **Properties**:
  - Solids/liquids/gases particle models
  - Temperature effects on state changes
- **Processes**:
  - Evaporation/condensation investigations
  - Water cycle demonstrations

**Common Misconception**:
"Steam is visible water vapour" (addressing gas invisibility)

---

## 4. Physics
### Sound
- **Vibrations**:
  - Investigate with tuning forks/rice on drums
  - Soundproofing materials test
- **Pitch/Volume**:
  - Relationship to vibration characteristics
  - String length/thickness experiments

### Electricity
- **Circuits**:
  - Construct series circuits with switches
  - Conductors/insulators testing
- **Components**:
  - Recognise symbols (battery, bulb, wire)
  - Troubleshoot broken circuits

---

## Assessment Framework
### Working Towards Expected
- Group living things using simple keys
- Describe basic state changes
- Build simple series circuits

### Expected Standard
- Explain digestive processes sequentially
- Predict sound vibration patterns
- Analyse habitat survey data

### Greater Depth

---

## Teaching Approaches
### Practical Requirements
1. **Exploration**: Minimum 5 investigations per term
2. **STEM Links**: DT - Design animal classification apps
3. **Fieldwork**: Local ecosystem studies

**Lesson Structure**:
- Engage (Provocation question)
- Explore (Hands-on investigation)
- Explain (Scientific modelling)
- Elaborate (Real-world application)
- Evaluate (Reflection)
