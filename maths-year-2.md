# Year 2 Mathematics Syllabus (UK National Curriculum)
*Statutory Programme of Study (DfE 2014, Updated for Mathematics Guidance 2020)*

---

## 1. Number and Place Value
### Statutory Requirements
- Count in steps of 2, 3, and 5 from 0
- Read/write numbers to at least 100 in numerals/words
- Compare/order numbers using >, <, and = 
- Recognise place value in 2-digit numbers (tens/ones)
- Use £/p symbols accurately (e.g., £1.43)

**Non-Statutory Guidance**:
> "Pupils should partition numbers in different ways (e.g., 23 = 20 + 3 and 23 = 10 + 13)" - NCETM

**Key Vocabulary**:  
*Digit, tens, ones, greater than, less than, exchange.*

---

## 2. Addition and Subtraction
### Calculation Methods
- Solve problems with **concrete objects** and **pictorial representations**
- Use **number bonds to 20** fluently (with derivations to 100)
- Add/subtract:  
  - Two-digit numbers (e.g., 34 + 25)  
  - One-digit to two-digit (e.g., 47 + 6)  
- Recognise inverse relationships (e.g., 8 + 4 = 12 → 12 - 4 = 8)

**Formal Methods Introduced**:
- **Column addition** (no regrouping)
- **Number line subtraction** (counting back)

---

## 3. Multiplication and Division
### Statutory Objectives
- Recall **2, 5, 10 times tables** (including missing number problems)
- Calculate using repeated addition (e.g., 5 + 5 + 5 = 15)
- Solve one-step problems with arrays (e.g., 3 rows of 4)
- Understand sharing/grouping (e.g., "12 shared into 3 groups")

**Practical Resources**:
- Counting sticks
- Array cards
- Numicon

---

## 4. Fractions
### Required Knowledge
- Recognise **½, ¼, ⅓, ¾** of shapes/quantities
- Write simple fractions (e.g., 1/2 of 6 = 3)
- Compare fractions (e.g., ½ > ¼)

**Common Misconceptions**:
- Thinking 1/4 is always larger than 1/2 because 4 > 2

---

## 5. Measurement
### Key Areas
| Topic | Skills | Example |
|-------|--------|---------|
| **Length** | cm/m, rulers/tape measures | Compare pencils |
| **Mass** | g/kg, balance scales | Weigh fruit |
| **Capacity** | ml/l, measuring jugs | Fill containers |
| **Time** | Quarter hours, AM/PM | School timetable |
| **Money** | Combine coins, give change | Shop role-play |

**STEM Links**:  
Science investigations requiring measurement recording.

---

## 6. Geometry
### Properties of Shapes
- Identify **2D shapes**: pentagons, hexagons, quadrilaterals
- Recognise **3D shapes**: cones, cylinders
- Describe **vertices**, **edges**, and **faces**

### Position/Direction
- Use mathematical language:  
  *left/right, clockwise, North/South*
- Simple compass directions

---

## 7. Statistics
### Data Handling
- Interpret **tally charts**, **pictograms** (1 symbol = 1 unit)
- Construct **block diagrams**
- Answer questions like:  
  *"How many more children chose pizza?"*

---

## Assessment (End of Year Expectations)
### Working Towards Expected
- Count reliably to 100
- Use number bonds to 20
- Tell time to half hour

### Expected Standard
- Add/subtract two-digit numbers
- Know 2/5/10 times tables
- Recognise £/p relationships

### Greater Depth
- Solve missing number problems (e.g.,  ☐ - 17 = 5)
- Explain fraction equivalence (e.g., 2/4 = 1/2)

---

## Teaching Sequence (Weekly)
1. **Daily Fluency**: 10-min number sense drills
2. **Main Lesson**: Concrete → Pictorial → Abstract
3. **Problem Solving**: Bar modelling introduced
4. **Friday Review**: Arithmetic/marking gaps

**Ofsted Focus Areas**:  
- Progress from Year 1  
- Mathematical reasoning  
- STEM vocabulary use  

---

## Required Resources
- **Manipulatives**: Base 10, Cuisenaire rods
- **Measuring Tools**: Class set of rulers/balances
- **Digital**: DfE-approved apps (e.g., Numbots)

*This syllabus reflects the National Curriculum (2014) and DfE Mathematics Guidance (2020), including COVID recovery recommendations.*
