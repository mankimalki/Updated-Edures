# Year 3 Mathematics Syllabus (UK National Curriculum)
*Statutory Programme of Study (DfE 2014, Updated per Mathematics Guidance 2020 & KS2 Teacher Assessment Frameworks)*

---

## 1. Number and Place Value
### Statutory Requirements
- Count in multiples of 4, 8, 50 and 100
- Read/write numbers to 1000 in numerals/words
- Compare/order numbers using <, >, = 
- Recognise place value in 3-digit numbers (HTO)
- Solve number problems with 100 more/less

**Non-Statutory Guidance**:
> "Use Dienes blocks to physically exchange 10 ones for 1 ten" - NCETM Professional Development Materials

**Key Vocabulary**:  
*Hundreds, thousands, digit, ascending, descending, estimate.*

---

## 2. Addition and Subtraction
### Calculation Methods
- Mentally add/subtract:
  - 1s/10s/100s to/from 3-digit numbers
  - Near doubles (e.g., 35 + 36)
- Formal written methods:
  - **Column addition** (with regrouping)
  - **Expanded subtraction** (decomposition)
- Solve missing number problems (e.g.,  ☐ - 45 = 128)

**STEM Links**:  
Science data recording (e.g., adding daily temperatures)

---

## 3. Multiplication and Division
### Statutory Objectives
- Recall **3, 4, 8 times tables** (including division facts)
- Multiply 2-digit × 1-digit (using grid method)
- Divide 2-digit ÷ 1-digit (with remainders)
- Recognise commutativity (e.g., 3 × 4 = 4 × 3)

**Practical Resources**:
- Times tables rockstars
- Array cards
- Place value counters

---

## 4. Fractions
### Required Knowledge
- Count in tenths
- Recognise equivalent fractions (e.g., ½ = 2/4)
- Add/subtract fractions with same denominator
- Solve money problems (£.p)

**Common Misconceptions**:
- Thinking 1/8 is larger than 1/4 because 8 > 4

---

## 5. Measurement
### Key Areas
| Topic | Skills | Example Activity |
|-------|--------|------------------|
| **Length** | m/cm/mm conversions | Measure classroom objects |
| **Mass** | g/kg, read scales | Compare parcel weights |
| **Capacity** | ml/l, measuring cylinders | Make 'perfect potions' |
| **Time** | 12/24hr, Roman numerals | Train timetable problems |
| **Money** | Give change from £10 | Class shop project |

**Ofsted Focus**:  
Real-world application of measurement skills

---

## 6. Geometry
### Properties of Shapes
- Identify horizontal/vertical/parallel lines
- Recognise 2D shapes (including octagons)
- Describe 3D shapes using faces/edges/vertices

### Position/Direction
- Plot coordinates (first quadrant)
- Use compass directions (NESW)

---

## 7. Statistics
### Data Handling
- Interpret bar charts (scaled in 2s, 5s, 10s)
- Create pictograms (symbol = multiple units)
- Solve comparison/sum problems

---

## Assessment Framework
### Working Towards Expected
- Count in multiples of 4, 8, 50, 100
- Know 3,4,8 times tables
- Measure simple lengths

### Expected Standard
- Add/subtract 3-digit numbers
- Tell time to nearest minute
- Recognise equivalent fractions

### Greater Depth
- Solve multi-step word problems
- Explain fraction relationships
- Use reasoning about odd/even numbers

---

## Teaching Sequence (Weekly)
1. **Daily Fluency**: 15-min arithmetic practice
2. **Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract**: Following mastery approach
3. **Problem Solving**: Bar modelling introduced
4. **Friday Review**: Low-stakes quiz with diagnostic marking

**Intervention Requirements**:  
- Times tables catch-up for bottom 20%
- SEND: Pre-teaching vocabulary with visual aids

---

## Required Resources
- **Manipulatives**: Place value counters, fraction walls
- **Measuring Tools**: Class set of trundle wheels
- **Digital**: DfE-approved apps (e.g., Maths-Whizz)

*This syllabus complies with the National Curriculum (2014) and DfE Mathematics Guidance (2020), including COVID recovery recommendations for arithmetic fluency.*
