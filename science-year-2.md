# Year 2 Science Syllabus (UK National Curriculum)
*Statutory Programme of Study for Key Stage 1 (DfE 2014, Updated per Ofsted Research Review 2021)*

---

## 1. Working Scientifically
### Core Skills (National Curriculum Statements)
- **Observing**: Compare/contrast using 5 senses with simple equipment
- **Testing**: Perform simple comparative tests (fair testing introduced)
- **Recording**: Create basic tables, bar charts and pictograms
- **Evaluating**: Suggest improvements like "next time I would..."

**Ofsted Focus Areas**:
> "Pupils should understand science answers 'how' questions, not just 'what'" - Science Research Review 2021

## 2. Biology
### Living Things and Their Habitats
- **Classification**:
  - Group animals by diet (carnivore/herbivore/omnivore)
  - Sort living/dead/never alive (e.g., rock vs. twig vs. worm)
- **Habitats**:
  - Compare local habitats (woodland vs. pond)
  - Basic food chains (grass → rabbit → fox)
  - Microhabitats (under logs/in bushes)

**Required Investigation**:
- "Woodlice Choice Chamber" experiment testing habitat preferences

### Plants
- **Growth Requirements**:
  - Investigate what plants need (light/water control experiments)
  - Observe bulb/seed growth timelines
- **Plant Parts**:
  - Function of roots/stems/leaves/flowers
  - Seasonal changes (deciduous trees)

---

## 3. Chemistry (Uses of Everyday Materials)
### Statutory Content
- **Material Properties**:
  - Flexibility, transparency, waterproofness
  - Suitability for purposes (umbrellas, windows)
- **Changes**:
  - Melting/freezing (water observations)
  - Bending/twisting reversible changes

**Common Misconceptions Addressed**:
- "All shiny materials are metal"
- "Ice is a different material from water"

---

## 4. Physics
### Animals Including Humans
- **Life Processes**:
  - Basic needs for survival (food/water/air)
  - Exercise/hygiene importance
- **Body Parts**:
  - Link senses to body parts (eyes/ears etc.)
  - Offspring growth (baby → adult comparisons)

### Forces
- **Movement**:
  - Push/pull forces (toy cars on ramps)
  - Friction (surfaces testing)
- **Magnets**:
  - Magnetic materials investigation
  - Poles (attract/repel)

---

## Assessment Framework
### Working Towards Expected
- Name basic plant/animal parts
- Sort materials by single property

### Expected Standard
- Conduct fair test with adult support
- Explain simple habitat adaptations

### Greater Depth
- Suggest multiple material uses
- Predict food chain consequences

---

## Teaching Approaches
### Practical Requirements
1. **Exploration**: 50% lesson time doing hands-on activities
2. **Questioning**: "What would happen if...?" prompts
3. **Recording**: Science journals with drawings/measurements

**STEM Connections**:
- DT: Build animal shelters
- Maths: Measure plant growth in cm

---

## Required Resources
| Topic | Essential Equipment | Safety Notes |
|-------|---------------------|--------------|
| Plants | Seeds, bulbs, rulers | Gloves for soil |
| Materials | Fabric/plastic/metal samples | No sharp edges |
| Magnets | Bar magnets (marked N/S) | Keep from electronics |

**Digital Tools**:
- BBC Bitesize interactive activities
- Time-lapse plant growth apps

---

## Cross-Curricular Links
- **English**: Write instructions for experiments
- **Geography**: Local habitat surveys
- **Art**: Sketch seasonal tree changes

*This syllabus meets all National Curriculum (2014) requirements and incorporates Ofsted's emphasis on substantive knowledge and disciplinary skills. Schools must follow CLEAPSS guidance for practical work.*
