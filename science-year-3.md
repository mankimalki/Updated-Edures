# Year 3 Science Syllabus (UK National Curriculum)
*Statutory Programme of Study for Lower Key Stage 2 (DfE 2014, Updated per Ofsted Research Review 2023)*

---

## 1. Working Scientifically
### Core Skills (Aligned with National Curriculum)
- **Planning**: Design simple comparative/fair tests (one variable changed)
- **Measuring**: Use standard units (newtons, °C) with increasing precision
- **Recording**: Construct bar charts with labelled axes (scaled in 2s, 5s, 10s)
- **Evaluating**: Identify anomalous results and suggest reasons

**Ofsted Focus**:  
"Pupils should move from describing to explaining scientific phenomena" - Science Research Review 2023

## 2. Biology
### Plants
- **Life Cycles**: 
  - Seed dispersal mechanisms (wind, animal, water)
  - Flowering plant stages (seed → germination → growth → reproduction)
- **Function Investigation**:
  - Water transport in stems (celery dye experiment)
  - Leaf structure (stomata observation with magnifiers)

**Required Practical**:  
"Does seed size affect germination rate?" (Fair test with cress seeds)

### Animals Including Humans
- **Nutrition**:
  - Food groups and balanced diets (carbohydrates, proteins, etc.)
  - Skeletal/muscular system (protection, support, movement)
- **Health**: 
  - Importance of exercise/nutrition
  - Hygiene and disease prevention

---

## 3. Chemistry
### Rocks and Soils
- **Rock Types**:
  - Sedimentary (chalk), igneous (granite), metamorphic (marble)
  - Fossil formation processes
- **Soil Investigation**:
  - Permeability testing (sand vs clay)
  - Local soil profile analysis

**Common Misconception**:  
"All rocks are hard and permanent" (addressing weathering/erosion)

---

## 4. Physics
### Light
- **Properties**:
  - Light travels in straight lines (shadow investigation)
  - Reflection using mirrors/foil
- **Eye Safety**: 
  - Never look directly at the sun
  - Protective eyewear for experiments

### Forces and Magnets
- **Magnetic Forces**:
  - Materials testing (iron, steel, aluminium)
  - Poles (attraction/repulsion)
- **Contact Forces**:
  - Friction investigations (surfaces, gradients)
  - Introduction to gravity (weight vs mass)

---

## Assessment Framework
### Working Towards Expected
- Identify basic plant parts/functions
- Group rocks by observable properties
- Record simple measurements

### Expected Standard
- Explain seed dispersal methods
- Conduct fair test with one variable
- Use scientific vocabulary correctly

### Greater Depth
- Predict rock formation processes
- Design multi-stage investigations
- Analyse unexpected results

---

## Teaching Approaches
### Practical Requirements
1. **Exploration**: Minimum 3 investigations per topic
2. **STEM Links**: DT - Design seed dispersal models
3. **Fieldwork**: Local area rock/soil survey

**Typical Lesson Structure**:
- Engage (5min demo/question)
- Investigate (20min hands-on)
- Explain (10min discussion)
- Extend (5min real-world application)

---

## Required Resources
| Topic | Essential Equipment | Risk Assessment |
|-------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Plants | Seeds, magnifiers, petri dishes | Allergen check |
| Rocks | Sample sets, streak plates | Silica dust control |
| Magnets | Bar magnets, compasses | Pacemaker safety |

**Digital Tools**:
- Explorify for scientific questioning
- British Geological Survey rock ID apps

---

## Cross-Curricular Links
- **Geography**: Rock cycle and landforms
- **Maths**: Data recording in tables/graphs
- **English**: Explanatory texts about experiments

*This syllabus meets all National Curriculum (2014) requirements and incorporates Ofsted's emphasis on substantive knowledge progression from KS1. All practical work follows CLEAPSS Primary Science guidelines.*
